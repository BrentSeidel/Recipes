%=================================
\chapter{Introduction}
This is a collection of recipes that I've made and liked.  I'm not a particularly skilled baker or cook, so these should be usable by most people.  I'm also a bit lazy, so these are mostly fairly easy recipes that will provide good results with minimal effort.

All of these recipes are vegetarian, but may not be vegan.  Feel free to adjust them to your needs.

\section{Hints}
Here are a few things that I've learned that may be helpful to others.
\begin{itemize}
  \item All recipes are works in progress.  They can always be tweaked a bit.  What tastes good to me may not taste good to you (and vice versa).  Feel free to adjust things to your taste.
  \item A set of small (about 1/4 cup size) glass bowls are useful to measure out ingredients before mixing them together.
  \item A kitchen scale is handy for weighing ingredients.
  \item In most cases, measurements don't have to be scientifically precise.  This is not analytical chemistry.
  \item Make sure that you have all the ingredients before starting a recipe.
  \item If practical, measure out all the ingredients before mixing.
  \item While you are waiting for dough to rest or rise is a good time to clean or work on other steps.
  \item Many of these recipes are based on ones I found on the internet.  In these cases, I've generally adjusted the recipes to be more suitable to what I want.  Feel free to do the same.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Measurements}
Most recipes that I've found use volume measurements for dry ingredients.  The actual amount may vary depending on how tightly packed the volume is.  In my recipes, I've tried to include the weight in grams for the dry ingredients.  Below is a list of weights for volumes of ingredients and other useful conversions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item bread flour (and probably other kinds), 1 cup is 175g
  \item sugar, 1tbsp is 8g
  \item salt, 1 tsp is 4g
  \item yeast, 1 package is 8g
  \item 16 tbsp is 1 cup
  \item 8 oz is 1 cup (hence 2 tbsp is 1 liquid oz)
\end{itemize}

%=================================
\chapter{Yeasted Breads}
Yeasted, kneaded breads.  There are many ways to make bread.  This is only one of them.  Feel free to experiment to see if you get results more to your liking.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Temperature, humidity, and altitude can affect the results.
  \item Using more water will result in a wetter dough that sticks to your hands more when kneading.  It may produce results more to your liking though.
  \item I don't worry too much about the starting temperature of the ingredients.  I figure that by the time everything is mixed and kneaded it's pretty much to ambient temperature.
  \item When the house is cool, I'll preheat the oven to 100\degree{}F and turn it off before putting the dough in the oven to rise.  Note that there are some techniques (that I haven't tried) that involve letting the bread rise in a refrigerator for several days.
  \item When it is dry, I'll keep a little water around to sprinkle on the dough while shaping it.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Basic Bread}
\label{bread:Basic}
This is based on the Sun-dried Tomato Basil bread (section \ref{bread:SundriedTomatoBasil}) with the flavorings removed.  This recipe makes one loaf of bread.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 package ($\frac{1}{4}$ ounce) (8g) active dry yeast
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ cup (182g) water
  \item 1 tablespoon (8g) sugar
  \item 1 tablespoon (5-8g) olive oil
  \item 1 teaspoon (4g) salt
  \item 2 cups (350g) bread flour
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water.
  \item Stir in sugar, olive oil, and salt.  Be sure to add the sugar first and the salt last.  Once this is fairly well mixed, move on to the next step.
  \item Add the flour and mix it in.  While adding the flour, you'll probably want to shift from mixing with a spoon to using your hands.  The dough doesn't need to be a single lump before moving on.  The kneading process will help to merge everything together.
  \item Turn onto a floured surface; knead until the gluten is well developed, about 5-10 minutes.
  \item Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.
  \item Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-2 hour (more if the water was not warm).
  \item Shape the dough however you like.  Note that the dough was greased while rising, so it doesn't need a floured surface to be worked.
  \item Cover a baking pan with parchment paper, a silicon baking mat, or grease.
  \item Cover and let rise until doubled, about $\frac{1}{2}$ hour.
  \item Bake at 375\degree{}F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.
  \item Remove from pan to a wire rack too cool.
\end{itemize}

\section{Sun-dried Tomato Basil Braided Bread}
\label{bread:SundriedTomatoBasil}
I got inspired to make this after watching too many episodes of the Great British Baking Show (aka Great British Bake-off).  After finding a suitable bread recipe (yeasted, kneaded), I modified it a bit for my use.  Interestingly, on the show, the mix the dry ingredients first before adding liquid while the recipes I found start with the liquid and then add flour.  It should work either way, but if you do the dry ingredients first, Paul Hollywood says to make sure to put the yeast on the opposite side of the bowl from the salt.

If you don't have sun dried tomatoes available, you can use tomato paste.  Just slightly reduce the amount and add some oil.  If you don't have fresh basil, you can use dried basil, but dried basil is lighter than fresh basil since it has lost its water you need to reduce the weight.

The quantities of the basil, Parmesan cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and garlic are not critical.  Feel free to adjust them to taste.  I'm also playing with adding a bit of Feta cheese to see if it helps.

If you are in a hurry, using warm water will make the first rising of the dough faster.  Otherwise, using cool water will slow the process, but may improve the flavor.

This recipe makes one loaf of bread.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 package ($\frac{1}{4}$ ounce) (8g) active dry yeast
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ cup (182g) water
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ cup (3-6g) minced fresh basil (5-10 leaves)
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ cup (25g) grated Parmesan cheese
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ cup (56g) chopped sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil (if not in oil, add a little bit of oil to the recipe).
  \item 1 tablespoon (8g) sugar
  \item 2 crushed cloves of garlic (5g)
  \item 1 teaspoon (4g) salt
  \item 2 cups (350g) bread flour
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water and let set for a minute or two.  You can use this time to prep the next ingredients.
  \item Stir in basil, Parmesan cheese, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, and salt..
  \item Add the flour and mix it in.  While adding the flour, you'll probably want to shift from mixing with a spoon to using your hands.  The dough doesn't need to be a single lump before moving on.  The kneading process will help to merge everything together.
  \item Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5-10 minutes.
  \item Place in an oiled bowl, turning once to oil top.  Note that the oil is really optional as the dough isn't too sticky.
  \item Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-2 hour (possibly more if the water was not warm).
  \item Braid the dough per section \ref{tip:Braid}.  Note that the dough was greased while rising, so it doesn't need a floured surface to be worked.
  \item Cover a baking pan with parchment paper, a silicon baking mat, or grease.
  \item Braid the strands together on the baking pan.
  \item Cover and let rise until doubled, about $\frac{1}{2}$ hour to a full hour.
  \item Bake at 375\degree{}F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.
  \item Remove from pan and place on a wire rack too cool.
\end{itemize}

\section{Braided Herb Bread}
\label{bread:Herb}
We have a bunch of fresh herbs growing, so I decided to try and make bread with them.

The quantities of the herbs are not critical.  I just used how much I was willing to take the time to prepare.  If you don't have fresh herbs or the time to prepare them, you can used dried.  Feel free to adjust them to taste.  It probably needs more than I used here.  The next time I try, I will update the recipe.

If you are in a hurry, using warm water will make the first rising of the dough faster.  Otherwise, using cool water will slow the process, but may improve the flavor.

This recipe makes one loaf of bread.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 package ($\frac{1}{4}$ ounce) (8g) active dry yeast
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ cup (182g) water
  \item 4 g basil (chopped) (about 20 leaves)
  \item 4 g rosemary
  \item 3 g oregano (chopped)
  \item 4 g thyme
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ cup (25g) grated Parmesan cheese
  \item 1 tablespoon (5-8g) olive oil
  \item 1 tablespoon (8g) sugar
  \item 1 teaspoon (4g) salt
  \item 2 cups (350g) bread flour
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water.
  \item Stir in sugar, herbs, oil, and salt.  Be sure to add the sugar first and the salt last.  Once this is fairly well mixed, move on to the next step.
  \item Add the flour and mix it in.  While adding the flour, you'll probably want to shift from mixing with a spoon to using your hands.  The dough doesn't need to be a single lump before moving on.  The kneading process will help to merge everything together.
  \item Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5-10 minutes.  Note that if dry herbs are used, the dough may be too dry.  You can spritz it with a little water while kneading to help, but don't over-do it.
  \item Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.
  \item Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-2 hour (more if the water was not warm).
  \item Braid the dough per section \ref{tip:Braid}.  Note that the dough was greased while rising, so it doesn't need a floured surface to be worked.
  \item Cover a baking pan with parchment paper, a silicon baking mat, or grease.
  \item Braid the strands together on the baking pan.
  \item Cover and let rise until doubled, about $\frac{1}{2}$ hour.
  \item Bake at 375\degree{}F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.
  \item Remove from pan to a wire rack too cool.
\end{itemize}

\section{Generic Rolls}
\label{bread:Rolls}
This is included with breads since it uses a similar recipe, it could also almost be considered to be a pastry.  Many variations of this recipe are possible.  I've done both a sweet and a savory version of the rolls.  I also have some more ideas that I haven't yet tried.  You could make cinnamon rolls based on this, or use your imagination.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ cup (182g) water
  \item 1tbsp (5-8g) oil
  \item 8g active dry yeast
  \item 8g sugar
  \item 4g salt
  \item 350g all purpose flour
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in water.
  \item Add the sugar.  You can do these two steps before preparing the rest of the ingredients.
  \item Add the oil and any dough flavorings.
  \item Add the salt.
  \item Mix in the flour.
  \item You can use a dough scraper to cut through the dough multiple times to mix it without kneading.
  \item Place the dough back in the bowl and cover to let rise for 1-2 hours.
  \item Turn the dough out onto the counter top.
  \item Roll the dough into a rectangular shape a few millimeters thick.  If you have trouble with the dough tearing, knead it a few times.
  \item Spread the filling on the dough.
  \item Roll the dough and filling up like you were making cinnamon rolls.
  \item Place some parchment paper on a baking pan.
  \item Slice the roll into 2-3cm segments and place on baking pan (dental floss works well for this).
  \item Cover and let rise for another hour or two.
  \item Bake at 375\degree{}F for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Variations}
Here are a couple of things that I've tried with good results.
\subsubsection{Garlic Cheese Rolls}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add 5-15g crushed or minced garlic with the oil when mixing the dough (depending on how much you like garlic)
  \item After rolling out the dough, spread shredded cheese (choose your favorite varieties) on the dough.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Orange Nutella\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Rolls}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add 5-10g of orange zest with the oil when mixing the dough (depending on how much orange flavor you want).  Note that after a bit of experimenting, it seems that the orange zest slows the rising of the dough.  It may be better to add it to the filling and just use the generic dough.
  \item Chop a few pecans (or other nuts)
  \item After rolling out the dough, spread Nutella\textsuperscript{\textregistered} or similar spread on the dough and sprinkle the chopped nuts.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Pesto Tear-and-Share}
This uses basically the dough from the Sun-dried Tomato Basil bread (section \ref{bread:SundriedTomatoBasil}) and uses it to make a tear-and-share.  The only difference is that I didn't add basil since my basil plants had succumbed to frost and the pesto has lots of basil anyway.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dough from section \ref{bread:SundriedTomatoBasil} (with, or without basil added)
  \item Your favorite pesto (or any other sauce or spread that sounds good to you)
  \item Any other fillings.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item After letting the dough rise the first time, separate it into two equal portions.
  \item Roll each portion about 5mm or $\frac{1}{4}$ inch thick in the same shape (one portion will be placed on the other).
  \item Spread your fillings on the lower portion of dough and place the other portion on top.
  \item Using a knife, make cuts from near the center to the edge (you want strips of bread that are still attached together).
  \item Give each strip a twist or two.
  \item Cover and let rise for about an hour.
  \item Bake at 400\degree{}F for about 15 minutes or until golden brown
\end{itemize}

\section{Buttermilk Biscuits}
This seems to be a fairly robust recipe.  I've made it a couple of times and mixed up some of the ingredients and they still turned out fine.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 350g all purpose flour
  \item 2tsp baking powder
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$tsp baking soda
  \item 1tsp salt
  \item 7tsp unsalted butter, froze and cut into small pieces
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ cup cold buttermilk
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Preheat oven to 425\degrees{}F
  \item Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl
  \item Work the frozen butter into the mixture until it resembles crumbs.  You can use a pastry cutter, but I like to just use my hands
  \item Make a little depression in the center and add the buttermilk
  \item Stir gently until combined
  \item Turn the dough onto a work surface and form into a rectangular shape
  \item Fold inwards in thirds along the long axis
  \item Form back into a rectangular shape and repeat two more times
  \item Flatten dough to about $\frac{1}{2}$ inch thick (about 1cm).
  \item Use a 2-$\frac{1}{2}$ inch biscuit cutter to cut biscuits.  I've seen recommendations to just press the cutter straight down and not twist it
  \item Put a sheet of parchment paper or silicone baking mat on a baking sheet
  \item Transfer biscuits to baking sheet
  \item You can brush buttermilk on top of the biscuits if you like, but they will be fine without
  \item Bake for 15 minutes or until flakey and golden brown
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Pies and Related}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Easy Shepherd's Pie/Pot Pie}
\label{pie:ShepherdsPie}
This is a real easy way to make some comfort food.  To make a pot pie, top with a pastry crust instead of mashed potatoes.  The measurements are not critical.  Feel free to experiment and find something that you like.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 can vegetable soup
  \item 1 can cream of celery soup
  \item 1 can cream of potato soup
  \item 1 can cream of broccoli soup
  \item 1 can sweet corn
  \item 1 can green beans
  \item hot sauce to taste
  \item 1 packet of instant mashed potatoes
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In a large bowl, mix the soups.
  \item Drain the corn and beans and add them to the mix.
  \item Add hot sauce to taste.
  \item Pour the mix into a casserole pan about an inch deep or so.
  \item In a separate bowl, prepare the instant mashed potatoes per the directions on the packet.
  \item Spread the mashed potatoes on top of the mixed soups and make a few holes to release steam.
  \item Bake at 375\degree{}F for about an hour, or until the mashed potatoes start browning and the soup mix is bubbling a little.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Quich\'e}
This is more of a concept than a strict recipe.  It's very easy to make and can be adjusted to whatever you have on hand or like to have.  Feel free to adjust and add whatever sounds good to you.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tater-Tots\textsuperscript{\textregistered} (or similar store brand potato puffs)
  \item A 16oz carton of egg whites
  \item Shredded cheese
  \item Chopped olives
  \item 5 fresh basil leaves
  \item Turmeric
  \item Black pepper
  \item Imitation bacon bits
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sparsely cover the bottom of a pie pan with the potato puffs and microwave for a couple of minutes to thaw them.
  \item Mash them down with a fork to fully cover the bottom.
  \item Bake for about 20 minutes at 375\degree{}F to help dry them out.
  \item Remove from oven and add the rest of the ingredients.
  \item Add a layer of shredded cheese to cover the bottom (due to the heat, this will melt a bit).
  \item Using the chiffonade method (section \ref{tip:Chiffonade}), chop the basil leaves and add them.
  \item Add the chopped black olives and imitation bacon bits (and whatever else you want).
  \item Add another layer of shredded cheese to fill the pie pan.
  \item Top with the ground black pepper and turmeric.
  \item Pour the egg whites over everything (with my pie pan, this fill it right up, you's may vary).
  \item Bake at 375\degree{}F for about 40 minutes.  The time isn't particularly critical.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Frittatas}
These are basically a quich\'e muffin.  These are easy to make and can be adjusted to your taste.  Here's what I've done.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A 16oz carton of egg whites (or equivalent whole eggs)
  \item One carrot grated
  \item Finely chopped broccoli
  \item Shredded cheese (whatever kind you like)
  \item A dash of hot sauce
  \item Seasonings (salt, pepper, turmeric, and/or whatever sounds good)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Grate the carrot into a mixing bowl
  \item Add a dash of hot sauce
  \item Add the eggs, broccoli, cheese, seasonings and stir.
  \item Divide into a non-stick 12 hole muffin pan (You could oil a regular muffin pan or use paper muffin cups).
  \item Preheat oven to 375\degree{}F and bake for about 35 minutes.
  \item After baking, from oven and let cool before removing from pan.
\end{itemize}

Note that these can be frozen and reheated later.

\section{Chocolate Cheesecake Bars}
This is based on a recipe that I found on the internet.  I've made it once and it turned out quite tasty even though things didn't go quite as I'd hoped.  This will probably change a bit if I make it again.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shortcrust pastry dough (section \ref{pastry:shortcrust}).
  \item Chocolate ganache (section \ref{extra:ChocolateGanache}).
  \item 8 oz (2 bars) bittersweet chocolate (I use Ghiradelli Premium Baking 60\% Cacao bars).
  \item 24 oz full fat cream cheese
  \item 1 cup granulated sugar
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ cup brown sugar (this could probably be just white sugar)
  \item 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
  \item 4 large eggs
  \item 2 egg yolks
  \item 1 cup heavy cream
  \item 2 tsp vanilla extract
  \item 1 small package of Raspberry Jello\textsuperscript{TM} (or equivalent.)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let the cream cheese, eggs, and cream reach room temperature.
  \item Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper.  Leave some hanging over on the sides so that you can remove the bars later.
  \item Make the shortcrust pastry dough and roll it out onto the bottom of the pan.
  \item Preheat the oven to 350\degree{}F and bake the crust for 10 minutes.  (I put another sheet of parchment paper over the crust and poured a package of dried beans on top of that).
  \item Chop the bittersweet chocolate into small chunks and melt (see section \ref{tip:MeltChocolate})
  \item Put the cream cheese into a mixing bowl and, using a mixer, mix until smooth (2 minutes or so).
  \item Add sugars and cocoa powder and mix until smooth.
  \item Add eggs, egg yolks and cream and mix for about 20 seconds.
  \item Fold in the chocolate.
  \item Add the vanilla and mix for another 20 seconds, or so.
  \item Using a spatula (and mixer, if needed) stir until everything is evenly mixed.
  \item Pour the mixture over the crust (I shouldn't have to tell you to remove anything that you placed over the crust).
  \item Bake for 30 minutes at 350\degree{}F.  The center should still have a bit of a wobble.  It will finish cooking as it cools.
  \item Remove cake from oven and carefully run a knife around the edge to loosen it from the parchment paper.
  \item Let cool completely in the pan.
  \item Mix the small package of raspberry jello and let cool until it starts to thicken (I poured the jello before it has started to thicken and it ran down around the cheese cake and collected mostly on the bottom.  It still tasted good, but didn't have the nice layer that I wanted.).
  \item Pour the jello over the cheesecake and let chill in the refrigerator until completely set (about 4 hours).
  \item Once set, add the chocolate ganache on top.
  \item Once the ganache sets, you can slice it and serve it.  It can also be frozen.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Cookies}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies}
This is a recipe that I've had for a while and haven't made recently.  I plan to make them again and update the recipe to be more consistent with the other recipes.  Many variations of this are possible.

When I was making these frequently, I would usually make a double batch.  For a double batch, I would use one package of mint (or raspberry) chocolate chips and one package of regular ones.  I would also use only 3 cups of oats instead of 4.  Feel free to experiment!
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 cup butter (or margarine)
  \item 200g (1 cup) sugar (white)
  \item 250g (1 cup) sugar (brown)
  \item 2 eggs
  \item 525g (3 cups) flour
  \item 1g ($\frac{1}{2}$ tsp) baking powder
  \item 5g (1 tsp) baking soda
  \item 4g ($\frac{1}{2}$ tsp) salt
  \item 1 pkg chocolate chips (8 oz, 300g)
  \item 200g (2 cups) rolled oats
  \item 1 tsp vanilla
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Blend together butter and sugars
  \item Add eggs and beat until light and fluffy
  \item Add flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder and mix well
  \item Add rolled oats, vanilla, and chocolate chips and mix well
  \item At this point, the dough is crumbly
  \item Drop by tsp onto a greased cookie sheet
  \item Bake for 15 minutes at 350\degree{}F
\end{itemize}
A batch makes about 48 cookies.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Gingerbread Cookies}
I made gingerbread once, but neglected to save the recipe.  So, I am trying again.  I went looking for recipes for gingerbread cookies and found several.  This is based on the simplest one that I found - many require an egg, this one doesn't.  Most of the recipes talked about how moist and chewy the cookies were while I'm looking for something more crisp and crunchy.  The quantities for the spices are only a starting point.  Feel free to adjust to taste.  I am still working on this - adding some cocoa and orange zest as well as reducing the amount of sugar.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 420g (3 cups) all-purpose flour
  \item 90-125g ($\frac{3}{4}$ cup) brown sugar
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ tsp baking soda
  \item 3g (1 tbsp) ground cinnamon
  \item 4g (1 tbsp) ground ginger
  \item $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp ground cloves
  \item 4-7g orange zest
  \item 4g (1 tbsp) cocoa powder
  \item $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp salt
  \item 12 tbsp butter (or margarine) chopped into little pieces (I keep my butter and margarine in the freezer because many other recipes need it that way.  It may not be needed for this one)
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ cup dark molasses
  \item 2 tbsp milk (or water)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl
  \item Using a pastry cutter or your hands, mix the butter or margarine in until well mixed.  Using your hands also lets you feel for and break up hard lumps of brown sugar.
  \item Slowly add the molasses and milk (or water) while mixing until well mixed.
  \item Divide into two pieces, roll each piece into a log about 1 inch in diameter, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze overnight.
  \item When ready to bake:
  \item Preheat oven to 350\degree{}F
  \item Unwrap one end of the frozen dough and slice about $\frac{1}{8}$ inch slices and place on a prepared cookie sheet.
  \item Bake for 8-11 minutes depending on how chewy or crispy you want your cookies.
  \item Remove from oven and allow to cool before decorating.
\end{itemize}
Remaining dough can be returned to the freezer.

\section{Macarons}
This is still quite experimental.  I am trying to make them using a carton of egg whites rather than separating eggs.  I've looked online and found everything from ``It can't be done'' to ``I do it all the time''.  So, I'm just going to have to try it myself.  After whisking for about half an hour, I did achieve something akin to stiff peaks.  I used the Kirkland brand egg whites from Costco and a clean stainless steel mixing bowl.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 100g egg whites at room temperature (white from 3 large eggs)
  \item 140g almond flour
  \item 90g granulated sugar
  \item 100g powered sugar
  \item 1tsp vanilla
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$tsp cream of tartar
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add the egg whites to a very clean bowl (I've seen suggestions of wiping the bowl with vinegar).
  \item Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar into a different bowl.
  \item Whisk the egg whites until the begin to foam.
  \item While continuing to whisk, add the cream of tartar and slowly add the granulated sugar.
  \item Keep whisking and add the vanilla.
  \item Continue whisking until stiff peaks form (this will probably take longer for carton egg whites - after 20 minutes, you might decide that separating eggs isn't so bad after all).
  \item Start folding in about $\frac{1}{3}$ of the dry ingredients.
  \item Carefully add the remaining dry ingredients while gently folding.
  \item Pipe about 1 inch circles onto parchment paper and let sit for about 40 minutes to form a ``skin''.
  \item Bake at 300\degree{}F for 12-15 minutes (possibly at the lower end of the range).
  \item Allow to cool completely before removing from baking sheet.
\end{itemize}

\section{Choux Pastry}
\label{pastry:choux}
This is the recipe for Choux pastry that can then be used for a number of things.  As such, this will end once you have the dough made.  Other recipes will tell you what to do with the dough and how to bake it.  If you are making a sweet pastry and have a bit of a sweet tooth, you can add some sugar along with the salt.

This pastry has a bit of a reputation for being fiddly, but as I was looking online I found a bit of variation.  So it's probably more robust that it's given credit for.  On the other hand, there is some disagreement about why after mixing the flour with the water and fat it's heated again.  Some say that's to dry the dough out, others say that there's a reaction that binds the fat and water around each individual particle of flour and water.  My suspicion is more towards the later.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 cup (228g) water
  \item 6 tablespoons (81g) butter or margarine
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ teaspoon (2g) salt
  \item 1 cup (175g) flour
  \item 4 large eggs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cut the butter or margarine into small chunks and add to the water.
  \item Add the salt.
  \item Bring the water to a boil.
  \item Once the water is boiling and all the butter or margarine is melted, remove from heat.
  \item Add the flour while mixing and ensure that there are no lumps
  \item Return to heat and cook until the dough pulls away cleanly from the sides of the saucepan.
  \item Let the dough cool enough so that it won't cook the eggs when you add them (about 150\degree{}F or so).
  \item Break and whisk the eggs into a separate container.
  \item Add the egg a bit at a time while mixing the dough.  After you add some egg, the dough becomes a lumpy, slimy mess, but it will eventually mix into a smooth dough again.  If you are mixing by hand, don't get discouraged.  Keep mixing and it will eventually be right.
  \item Stop when the dough is smooth and glossy.
\end{itemize}
The dough is now ready for other projects such as eclairs, profiteroles, cream puffs, and the like.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Shortcrust Pastry}
\label{pastry:shortcrust}
This is a basic 3 ingredient dough.  I'm not entirely happy with it yet and the dough turns out to be fairly crumbly.  This may be because I'm using margarine rather than butter.  It may also need a bit more water (I live in a dry climate).
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 225g all purpose flour
  \item 100g (one stick) margarine sliced into small pieces
  \item a pinch of salt
  \item 2-3 tbsp water
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Put the flour and margarine pieces in a large bowl.  Rub the flour and margarine together with your fingers until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
  \item Add a pinch of salt and mix in.
  \item Add the water and mix to form a firm dough.
  \item Kneed gently and briefly on a floured surface.
  \item Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate while you do other preparations.
  \item Roll out and add to pan.
\end{itemize}
If you are blind baking, bake at 375\degree{}F for 10 minutes or so will work.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{P\^ate Sucr\'ee}
\label{pie:PateSucree}
This translates to sweet dough or crust.  It is a French pastry used for making the crust for sweet tarts or pies.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 240g all purpose flour
  \item 70-75g sugar
  \item $\frac{1}{2}$tsp salt
  \item 125g (one stick) unsalted butter frozen
  \item 1 egg
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$tsp vanilla extract
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mix the flour, sugar, and salt.
  \item Cut the butter into small pieces and mix in.
  \item Add the egg and vanilla and mix until the dough starts to come together.
  \item Form dough into a ball, wrap with cling film, and chill for an hour.
  \item Break off dough (around 50-53g) and press into an oiled and floured tart/pie pan (should be no more than 3-4mm thick).
  \item You could also roll the dough out about 3-4mm thick and press it into the pans that way.
  \item Prick evenly with a fork
  \item Refrigerate for 20 minutes or more.
  \item Blind bake at 360\degree{}F for 15 minutes.
  \item Bake another 5-10 minutes (with my oven, it needed 10 minutes, or a bit more), or until pastry is golden (you can omit step this if the filling will need to be baked).
  \item Let cool before removing from tart/pie pan.
\end{itemize}
The baked shells can be frozen for storage.  Make sure to defrost before use.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Eclairs}
\label{pastry:Eclair}
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Choux pastry dough (see section \ref{pastry:choux})
  \item Stuff for filling
  \item Stuff for topping
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Place a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray
  \item Pipe the Choux pastry dough into lines on the paper.
  \item Bake at about 375\degree{}F for 35-45 minutes.
  \item Don't open the oven to check for the first 30 minutes.
  \item After 30 minutes in the oven, prick a small hole in the shells to let the steam out.
  \item Remove from the oven when done and let cool.
  \item Using the hole pricked, you can pipe the filling (such as the Chocolate Mousse in section \ref{extra:CCChocolateMousse} or Creme Patisserie in section  \ref{extra:CremePat}) into the eclair.
  \item Add whatever topping you wish (such as the Chocolate Ganache in section \ref{extra:ChocolateGanache}).
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Deep Fried Raspberry-Chocolate Wraps}
\label{pastry:RaspberryChocolateWrap}
I got the idea for these one day as I was eating some raspberries with a bag of chocolate chips nearby.  This recipe makes one wrap.  Scale up as needed.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3 Raspberries
  \item 3 Chocolate chips
  \item 1 Won-ton wrap
  \item A small amount of egg white (to seal the wraps)
  \item Powdered sugar
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Insert the chocolate chips into the raspberries.
  \item Line the three stuffed raspberries diagonally on the won-ton wrap.
  \item Roll up the won-ton wrap like a spring roll or a burrito and used a dab of egg white to seal.
  \item Deep fry at about 350\degree{} until golden brown.
  \item Drain and sprinkle with powdered sugar.
\end{itemize}
Warning: The contents will be hot.  Let cool a little before eating.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Cannoli}
Most of the cannoli recipes I found use wine and deep frying.  While there is something satisfying about dipping things in hot oil, it is a pain to setup and cleanup.  I also don't have any wine in the house.  So I searched for alternatives.  Here is a recipe that doesn't use wine and uses an air fryer.

I got 8 usable Cannoli shells from this for my first attempt.  It would have been 12, but four of them came off the forms to some extent.  Rolling the dough thinner would also produce more shells.  I think that using some more liquid would also help.  This will require some more experimentation.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 260g (1-1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
  \item 16g (2 tbsp) sugar
  \item 1g (1/2 tsp) ground cinnamon
  \item a pinch of salt
  \item 3 tbsp cold butter (or margarine) sliced into small pieces
  \item 3 tbsp white grape juice (this may not be enough - I used at least 4 more tsp)
  \item 1 large egg
  \item A small amount of egg white (to seal and egg wash the cannolis)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt, and mix.
  \item Mix in the butter (or margarine) until it resembles small pebbles.
  \item Add the egg and grape juice and mix until the dough begins to hold.
  \item Move the dough to a surface and knead until smooth (about 3-4 minutes)  (While kneading, you may need to add a little more grape juice if the dough is not coming together.  I put some juice in a cup and tipped out a few drops at a time.  When the dough is good, you can drink the remaining juice.)
  \item Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (it can be left overnight).
  \item Lightly coat dough with flour and roll out onto a floured surface to no more than 1/8 inch thick (a pasta machine could also be used) (the dough is dry enough that flouring may not be needed).
  \item Use a 4 inch round cookie cutter to cut circles from the dough.
  \item When you run out of room to cut circles, you can wad the dough up and roll it out again.
  \item Wrap each circle around a cannoli tube and seal with a little egg white.  Brushing the cannoli tubes with oil first makes is easier to remove the tubes afterwards, but be careful not to get oil where you want to seal the dough.  It will interfere with the seal.
  \item Brush your air fryer basket lightly with oil and preheat to 400\degree{}F.
  \item Place cannolis in the basket making sure to leave plenty of room for the air to circulate (only a few at a time).
  \item Cook for 4-5 minutes or until the shells are golden brown (timing may need to adjust for your air fryer).
  \item Let cool and remove from the tubes.
  \item You can cook the next batch while waiting for the previous batch to cool.
  \item At some point, you may need to let the basket cool down and reapply oil (I haven't tested this yet).
\end{itemize}

You can dip the ends of the shells in melted chocolate, if desired.

The shells can keep for a few days if they are not filled.  Once filled, they should be eaten quickly, lest they become soggy.

When you are ready to eat them, add the filling from section \ref{extra:CannoliFilling}, add any desired garnishes and lightly dust with powdered sugar.

\chapter{Extras}
These are things that can be used as topping, fillings, or sauces with other recipes.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Coconut Cream Chocolate Mousse}
\label{extra:CCChocolateMousse}
I went looking for chocolate mousse recipes and they all had raw eggs in them.  Personally, I don't like to use raw eggs, so I went looking for a vegan recipe.  There is a slight hint of coconut flavor in the finished product.  Depending on how you fell about this, it may be a good or a bad thing.  You could add more cocoa powder or a drop of vanilla extract (or something else) to help hide the flavor.  As an alternative, you can try the Tofu Chocolate Mousse (section \ref{extra:TofuChocolateMousse}).
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 can full fat coconut milk.  Refrigerate over night so that you can separate the cream (I measured 239g).  If you have a can of coconut cream, you can just use that directly.
  \item 3 tbsp (12g) cocoa powder
  \item 2 tbsp (18g) sugar
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Transfer the coconut cream to a bowl and beat until smooth.
  \item Beat in the cocoa powder and sugar.
  \item Continue to beat until it forms a mousse like texture.  You should probably pause occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Tofu Chocolate Mousse}
\label{extra:TofuChocolateMousse}
Here's an alternative to the Coconut Cream Chocolate Mousse (section \ref{extra:CCChocolateMousse}) that uses tofu.  If you don't like the faint taste of coconut, you can try this one.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 block of silken tofu - drained (about 454g).
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ cup (20g) cocoa powder
  \item 3 tbsp (27g) sugar
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start beating the tofu so that the block is broken up.
  \item Beat in the sugar and cocoa powder.
  \item Continue to beat until it forms a smooth mousse like texture.  You should probably pause occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Tofu Raspberry Mousse}
\label{extra:TofuRaspberryMousse}
This is basically the same as the Tofu Chocolate Mousse (section \ref{extra:TofuChocolateMousse}) except that is replaces chocolate with raspberry powder.  If you don't like the faint taste of coconut, you can try this one.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 block of silken tofu - drained (about 454g).
  \item 4 tbsp (24g) raspberry powder
  \item 2 tbsp (21g) sugar
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start beating the tofu so that the block is broken up.
  \item Beat in the sugar and raspberry powder.
  \item Continue to beat until it forms a smooth mousse like texture.  You should probably pause occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
\end{itemize}
Feel free to throw in some fresh raspberries or raspberry preserves.  The color from just using the raspberry powder is rather pale.  Perhaps some food coloring would help.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Chocolate Ganache}
\label{extra:ChocolateGanache}
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 2 bars good quality baking chocolate (225g)
  \item 1 cup heavy or whipping cream
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chop up the chocolate into small pieces.  I used a fine grater, but ran into trouble with static electricity flinging pieces around (see Section \ref{tip:GrateChocolate}).
  \item Put the chocolate pieces into a heatproof container.
  \item Heat the cream to a simmer.  Don't let it get to a full boil.
  \item Pour the heated cream over the chocolate pieces.
  \item Wait for a minute or so to let the chocolate to start melting.  Smaller pieces will melt faster.
  \item Mix until all the chocolate is melted and the mixture is uniform.
  \item Let cool for use.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Carmel/Spun Sugar}
This is a bit fiddly.  The first time I tried it, it wound up crystalizing instead of caramelizing.  Don't give up, try again.  To clean up, fill the pan with water and heat while stirring.  This will help dissolve the remaining sugar.

It might be a wise idea to have a large container, such as the kitchen sink, full of cool water just in case of burns from hot sugar.

\subsection{Discussion}
This process lies at the intersection of chemistry and physics.  There is still disagreement about whether sugar melts or decomposes (see \url{https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf3002526} for an example).  For our purposes, we will assume that it melts at 185\degree{}C.  This is quite a bit hotter than boiling water (100\degree{}C), so caution is advised to avoid burns.

Sugar naturally forms a crystalline solid.  This process attempts to make it into an amorphous solid.  It can be done, but is a bit tricky.  The basic process is to dissolve the sugar in water, boil the water off, then let the sugar heat until it caramelizes (this apparently can be done dry without any water, but is also tricky).  As the water boils off, this becomes a super-saturated solution.  Given the slightest provocation, it will form crystals.  Crystallization can be reduced by keeping the pot clean and making sure that no sugar crystals are present.  One can also add a little glucose or fructose to help break up the crystal structure.

Once the sugar is all dissolved, bring the mixture to a boil to get rid of the water.  Keep the pastry brush and water handy to keep the sides of the pan clean.  You can note a change in the boiling once the water is all gone.  At this point, the temperature can rise past the boiling point of water.  This is necessary for the caramelizing process.  If you just want a sugar syrup, you can quit at this point.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\frac{1}{2}$ cup (105g) granulated sugar
  \item 2 tablespoons water
\end{itemize}
Have another container of water handy and a pastry brush.
\subsection{Procedure}
If you want spun sugar, be sure to cover the working area with newspapers or something to catch errant globs of sugar.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Combine the sugar and water in a clean saucepan (I've heard that non-stick ones don't work, but haven't tried myself).
  \item Gently heat while stirring until all the sugar is dissolved.
  \item Turn the heat up and let boil undisturbed until the caramel starts to brown.  I was able to start smelling caramel at this point.  While boiling, use the pastry brush to dab water on any sugar crystalizing on the edges of the pan.
  \item Remove from heat and let cool a bit.
  \item If all you want are caramel shards, you can pour out onto something flexible and non-stick to let cool.
  \item If you want spun sugar, wait until thin strands of sugar come off your fork or whisk when you dip it in the cooling mix.
  \item Dip your mixer in the sugar mix and whip it back and forth rapidly over the area you want the spun sugar.
  \item After you've accumulated enough, you can pick it up and gently shape it.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Creme Patisserie}
\label{extra:CremePat}
This is a member of the custard family that can be piped for use as a filling in pastries.  If made a little thicker, it could be used as a dessert by itself, or piped onto other desserts.  Note that all the whisking will give your arm a good workout.  If you successfully separate all the egg yolks from the whites, you can use the leftover whites for a meringue (section \ref{extra:FrenchMeringue}, for example).  If you are not completely successful, you can make scrambled eggs or a quich\'e.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 2 cups (500g) whole milk
  \item 50-60g (6 tbsp) sugar
  \item a pinch of salt (maybe $\frac{1}{8}$ tsp)
  \item 20g-39g (3-5 tbsp) cornstarch (depending on how stiff you want the result)
  \item 4 large egg yolks (separating the eggs was the most difficult part for me, even with an egg separator)
  \item 3 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
\end{itemize}
The following ingredients are flavorings that I've used.  Feel free to adjust the quantities or try your own.  I have several more that I want to try.
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 tbsp vanilla extract (add to milk)
  \item 1 tsp ground cinnamon (add to milk)
  \item 7g orange zest (simmer in milk)
  \item 20-30g cocoa powder (add to milk)
  \item 10g raspberry juice powder (add to milk) (may need a bit more)
  \item $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp peppermint extract (add to milk) (may need a bit more)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
Note that if the flavorings that you add to the milk do not require the milk to be warmed, you can simply mix the milk and flavorings in with the egg mixture before heating.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add the flavorings that need to be simmered to the milk in a saucepan and slowly bring to a simmer.  If there are none, skip to mixing the milk with the egg mixture step.
  \item While waiting for the milk to warm:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add sugar, egg yolks, cornstarch, and salt in a bowl
    \item Whisk until the mixture is smooth
    \item Set aside until the milk is ready
  \end{itemize}
  \item Slowly pour about half of the milk mixture into the egg mixture while whisking constantly to temper the egg mixture
  \item After the egg mixture has been tempered, add it to the remaining hot milk mixture
  \item Heat on medium heat until it starts to thicken (about 1-2 minutes) while whisking vigorously.  If starting from cold milk, it will take longer.
  \item Keep whisking until it comes to a boil (pause whisking occasionally for a few seconds to look for bubbles)
  \item Once it starts to boil, lower the heat and cook for 1-2 minutes more while continuing to whisk
  \item Remove from heat and whisk in the butter until completely mixed
  \item Pour mixture into a bowl (I'm paranoid about contamination from raw eggs, so maybe a different one than the first bowl) and cover the surface of the mixture with plastic wrap.  This keeps air from the mixture and prevents a ``skin'' from forming.
  \item Let cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until completely chilled.  This should keep for 3 days, or so.
  \item Use as needed, but give it a whisk before use to make it smooth again.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{French Meringue}
\label{extra:FrenchMeringue}
I made these once to use up some leftover egg whites making Creme Patisserie.  I think that I baked them a little too long.  They were good, but
a bit crunchy.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Whites from 4 large eggs (possibly leftovers from making Creme Patisserie in section \ref{extra:CremePat}) at room temperature
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp Cream of Tartar
  \item 200g of sugar
  \item optional flavorings
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Optional Flavorings}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 20g cocoa powder
  \item 1 tsp raspberry powder (may need more)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item preheat oven to 220\degree{}F
  \item whip the eggs and cream of tartar at medium speed until foamy.  I use an electric mixer for this.
  \item whip the eggs and cream of tartar at high speed and slowly add the sugar.  If you have flavoring or color add it at this point.
  \item continue whipping until stiff peaks are reached.  This strains the limits of my cheap electric hand mixer.
  \item pipe meringue onto a cookie sheet
  \item bake until dry and can easily be removed (maybe 1 hour?)
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Lemon Curd}
\label{extra:LemonCurd}
This is based on an easy recipe that I found online.  It doesn't require separating the eggs and everything is mixed and heated at once.  It is similar to things like Creme Patisserie (section \ref{extra:CremePat}).  Feel free to try other flavors besides lemon.  Note that if you want to make something like a lemon meringue pie, you may wish to find a lemon curd recipe that uses just the egg yolks, so that the whites can be used for the meringue.

I've tried mixing some lime juice and lime zest in with the lemon juice and lemon zest with good results.  Some time, I will try using orange juice and orange zest. I've also been reducing the amount of sugar as I like things tart.  It's a matter of taste, so experiment and find out what tastes good to you.  It can also be frozen and thawed for use later.

I tried making orange curd by replacing the lemon juice and zest with orange juice and zest.  The result was orange flavored scrambled eggs.  I've read that lemon juice has more pectin than orange juice, so that may be the difference.  I will update this when I finally have a working recipe.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\frac{3}{4}$ cup fresh lemon juice
  \item 120-146g ($\frac{3}{4}$ cup) white sugar
  \item $\frac{1}{2}$ cup unsalted butter
  \item 3 large eggs
  \item 10g (1 tbsp) lemon zest
  \item 1 tbsp cornstarch (optional - makes it thicker when used as a filling)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cube the butter.
  \item Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.
  \item Heat with medium heat until mixture starts to thicken and gets to a boil (15-20 minutes, or so).  Whisk continually while heating to keep the eggs from curdling.
  \item Once it starts to thicken (you will know when it starts to thicken - the change is quite noticeable), you can lower the heat a little while it comes to a boil.  I let it boil for a minute or two before removing from heat.
  \item Remove from heat and transfer curd to a large bowl and cover the surface with plastic wrap.  This helps keep a ``skin'' from forming.  Or, I use the 28oz plastic peanut butter containers.  Once cleaned out, they are the right size for a batch.  You may wish to strain the curd while transferring to removed the zest.  Or, you could leave it in and tell people that it shows that it's from fresh lemons, like leaving the pulp in.
  \item Let cool to room temperature.
  \item Refrigerate until cool.  The curd will thicken as it cools.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Raspberry Curd}
\label{extra:RaspberryCurd|}
This is a modification of the Lemon Curd recipe to use raspberries.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 265g frozen raspberries
  \item $\frac{1}{4}$ cup fresh lemon juice
  \item 120-146g ($\frac{3}{4}$ cup) white sugar
  \item $\frac{1}{2}$ cup unsalted butter
  \item 3 large eggs
  \item 10g (1 tbsp) lemon zest
  \item 1 tbsp cornstarch (optional - makes it thicker when used as a filling)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cook the raspberries with the lemon juice until they soften and burst.
  \item Strain the raspberry seeds out of the mixture.
  \item Cube the butter.
  \item Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.
  \item Heat with medium heat until mixture starts to thicken and gets to a boil (10-15 minutes, or so).  Whisk continually while heating to keep the eggs from curdling.
  \item Once it starts to thicken (you will know when it starts to thicken - the change is quite noticeable), you can lower the heat a little while it comes to a boil.  I let it boil for a minute or two before removing from heat.
  \item Remove from heat and transfer curd to a large bowl and cover the surface with plastic wrap.  This helps keep a ``skin'' from forming.  Or, I use the 28oz plastic peanut butter containers.  Once cleaned out, they are the right size for a batch.  You may wish to strain the curd while transferring to removed the zest.  Or, you could leave it in and tell people that it shows that it's from fresh lemons, like leaving the pulp in.
  \item Let cool to room temperature.
  \item Refrigerate until cool.  The curd will thicken as it cools.
\end{itemize}

\section{Manicotti Filling}
\label{extra:ManicottFilling}
This is really a ``to-taste'' recipe.  Feel free to adjust quantities or and/remove ingredients as you wish.

I made this and it was enough to fill 11 Manicotti shells with a bit left over.  My wife liked them, but though that something crunchy, like chopped onions would be a good addition.

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 454g (1 lb) of Ricotta Cheese
  \item 20g crushed garlic
  \item 1tbsp dried basil (too light to register on my scale)
  \item 1tsp dried oregano (too light to register on my scale)
  \item 2g of onion poweder
  \item a dash of your favorite hot sauce (to taste)
  \item salt and black pepper to taste
  \item 100g shredded cheddar-jack mix
  \item 50g shredded parmesan cheese
  \item 1 egg
\end{itemize}

\section{Cannoli Filling}
\label{extra:CannoliFilling}
The filling can keep a couple days refrigerated in an airtight container.  This makes enough for about 8 Cannolis.  When I made this, I wound up letting the Ricotta drain for a couple of days and was worried that it would be too thick to pipe.  It worked fine.  I have read that if it is too stiff, mixing in some whipped cream will help.

Some recipes I've seen do not have the zest and have vanilla instead.  Try some different ones and pick the one you like.
\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3/4 cup Ricotta Cheese
  \item 70g (1/2) cup powdered sugar
  \item 2-5g (1 tsp) orange (and/or lemon and/or other citrus) zest (to taste)
  \item 60g (1/3) cup mini chocolate chips
  \item Garnishes such as chocolate chips, slice almonds, or anything else that sounds good.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Drain the Ricotta Cheese overnight.
  \item Gently mix the Ricotta and the sugar until well mixed.
  \item Add the zest and the mini chocolate chips until evenly distributed.
  \item When ready to use, place in a piping bag with a 1/2 inch nozzle.  Note that I've found that filling the shells with a spoon works just as well and is easier.
  \item Pipe the filling into the shells - fill half from each end.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chiffonade}
\label{tip:Chiffonade}
This is a procedure for thinly slicing herb or vegetable leaves.
\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item After washing and drying the leaves, stack them.
  \item Tightly roll the stack of leaves.
  \item Carefully slice off narrow strips perpendicular to the roll (watch your fingers).
\end{itemize}
After slicing, you can crosscut the thin strips to make smaller pieces.  This works well with basil.

\section{Grating Baker's Chocolate}
\label{tip:GrateChocolate}
I decided to try grating the chocolate the first time I made a chocolate ganache.  The ganache turned out quite good, but it's not clear that grating the chocolate was necessary.  My advice is that if you can avoid grating chocolate, do it.  If you must, here are some things I learned from experience.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Keep the chocolate and tools cool or cold.  The chocolate will melt in your hand.
  \item The grated bits of chocolate pick up a static charge and will fly off in unexpected directions.  Using a deep bowl rather than a plate will help to contain them.
  \item Be patient.  It may take a long time to get enough chocolate grated.
  \item The little bits of chocolate will get all over the place.  Be prepared to do some cleanup afterwards.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Melting Chocolate}
\label{tip:MeltChocolate}
Chocolate melts at a fairly low temperature.  The main concerns are to avoid overheating and contact with water.  Here are some methods:
\subsection{Microwaving}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Break the chocolate into small chunks and place in a microwave-safe bowl
  \item Microwave on high for a few (10-15) seconds and check.
  \item Repeat microwaving for a few seconds and checking until the chocolate is melted.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Water Heating}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fill a saucepan about $\frac{1}{3}$ of the way with water.
  \item Break the chocolate into small chunks and place in a heat resistant bowl.  (Note that the bowl needs to be enough bigger than the saucepan that the bottom doesn't touch the water when placed in the saucepan.)
  \item Put the saucepan on the stove and set the burner as low as it will go.
  \item Place the bowl in the saucepan and wait until the chocolate starts to melt.
  \item Stir occasionally until the chocolate is fully melted.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Stove Top}
If you are brave, careful, foolish, or some combination, you can try just melting the chocolate on the stovetop.  This may work best with an electric stove.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Turn the burner on low.
  \item Break the chocolate into small chunks and place in a saucepan.
  \item Once the burner has reached temperature, turn it off.
  \item Place the saucepan on the burner.
  \item Stir occasionally until the chocolate is fully melted.
  \item If the burner cools too much before the chocolate is fully melted, remove the saucepan, heat the burner, turn it off, and replace the saucepan.
\end{itemize}

\section{Braids}
\label{tip:Braid}
Braids can help things look fancier.  A braided loaf of bread looks much fancier than just a plain loaf.  As I was looking into various braids, I discovered that there is a branch of mathematics dedicated to braids called braid theory.  It seems to be related to knot theory.  I will try to restrain my digressions, but if you're interested, there is lots of material on the web for further research.

First, some notation.  For each strand $i$, two operators are defined.  The $\sigma^{-1}_i$ operation moves strand $i$ over strand $i+1$.  The $\sigma_i$ operation moves strand $i$ under strand $i+1$.  If you have $n$ strands, then the operators are not defined for $i=n$, since there is no strand $n+1$.

To be a little more concrete, assume that there are three strands so, $n=3$, and that the strands are laid horizontally with strand 1 at the top.  To make a normal three strand braid, you first move strand 1 over strand 2.  Then you move strand 3 over strand 2.  And repeat these two steps until you are finished.  The first move is just $\sigma^{-1}_1$.  The second move has to be expressed as $\sigma_2$.  This moves strand 2 under strand 3, which is the same thing as moving strand 3 over strand 2.  For 3 strands, the notation $\sigma_3$ is meaningless since it would move strand 3 under strand 4 and there is no strand 4.  So the notation for a normal 3 strand braid is $\sigma^{-1}_1\sigma_2$, repeated until finished.

When you have many strands, sometimes multiple moves will happen at approximately the same place.  I am using the notation $[\sigma_i, \sigma_j]$, where $\lvert i-j \rvert > 2$, to indicate this.

\subsection{One Strand}
This is the basic loaf.  Included only for completeness.  I suppose I could have also included zero strands, but that just takes nothing and produces nothing.

\subsection{Two Strands}
This is really a simple twist (see figure \ref{fig:2Strand}).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \center
  \includegraphics{Figures/2-strands.pdf}
  \caption{Two Strand Braid, Strand 1 Over Strand 2 ($\sigma^{-1}_1$)}
  \label{fig:2Strand}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Divide the dough into two equal lumps.
  \item Roll each lump into long strand.
  \item Lay the strands side-by-side and squeeze one end together.
  \item Move the first strand over the second strand ($\sigma^{-1}_1$).
  \item Repeat ($\sigma^{-1}_1$) until the end of the strands is reached.
  \item Squeeze the last end together.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Three Strands}
This is what most people think of when they think of a braid.  This is the typical three strand braid (see figure \ref{fig:3Strand}).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \center
  \includegraphics{Figures/3-strands.pdf}
  \caption{Three Strand Braid, ($\sigma^{-1}_1\sigma_2$) Repeated}
  \label{fig:3Strand}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Divide the dough into three equal lumps.
  \item Roll each lump into long strand.
  \item Lay the strands side-by-side and squeeze one end together.
  \item Move the first strand over the second strand ($\sigma^{-1}_1$), then move the third strand over the second strand ($\sigma_2$).
  \item Repeat ($\sigma^{-1}_1\sigma_2$) until the end of the strands is reached.
  \item Squeeze the last end together.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Four Strands}
There are probably multiple ways to do four or more strand braids.  I'm just listing the ones that I've used.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \center
  \includegraphics{Figures/4-strands.pdf}
  \caption{Four Strand Braid, ($[\sigma^{-1}_1\sigma^{-1}_3]\sigma_2$) Repeated}
  \label{fig:4Strand}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Divide the dough into four equal lumps.
  \item Roll each lump into long strand.
  \item Lay the strands side-by-side and squeeze one end together.
  \item Move the first strand over the second strand and the third strand over the fourth strand ($[\sigma^{-1}_1\sigma^{-1}_3]$).
  \item Then move the second strand under the third strand ($\sigma_2$).
  \item Squeeze the last end together.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Five Strands}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \center
  \includegraphics{Figures/5-strands.pdf}
  \caption{Five Strand Braid, ($[\sigma^{-1}_1 \sigma^{-1}_3][\sigma_2\sigma_4]$) Repeated}
  \label{fig:5Strand}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Divide the dough into five equal lumps.
  \item Roll each lump into long strand.
  \item Lay the strands side-by-side and squeeze one end together.
  \item Move the first strand over the second strand and third strand over the fourth strand ($[\sigma^{-1}_1 \sigma^{-1}_3]$).
  \item Move the second strand under the third strand and the fourth strand under the fifth strand ($[\sigma_2\sigma_4]$).
  \item Repeat ($[\sigma^{-1}_1 \sigma^{-1}_3][\sigma_2\sigma_4]$) until the end of the strands is reached.
  \item Squeeze the last end together.
\end{itemize}
